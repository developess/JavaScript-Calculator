## About this Project

I made a first draft of this project in November 2017, 8 months before joining Founders & Coders. I revisited it in June 2018 as part of the course pre-requisites, and ended up totally rewriting the basic JavaScript functionality into much shorter, cleaner code (relative to the very repetitve stuff I had previously)! 

I think the most interesting part of this project is how concise the JavaScript is for quite complex functionality (40 lines only). 

There is still functionality I haven't added. As part of rebuilding the JavaScipt I challenged myself to:
- [ ] add a functioning backspace button
- [ ] add a functioning x^2 button
- [ ] better handle long inputs / introduce rounding.
- [ ] allow input to be typed in
- [ ] allow compound calculations

While I made a start in updating the HTML and CSS to include the new buttons, I still need to program in the functionality for these!

Watch this space, but I hope to have this completed and updated by the end of the course.
